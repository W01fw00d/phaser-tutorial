# Speak through your Elbows

- Based on [Phaser 3 Official Tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game)

## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Local deployment

You need to serve `index.html` in a server in order to run it locally.

I recommend using the VScode extension [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

## Visual Regression Testing

After having deployed the game locally, just run:

```
npm run test
```
